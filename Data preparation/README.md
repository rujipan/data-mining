**Data preparation** is the essential process of cleaning and transforming raw, messy data into a clean and structured format suitable for analysis. It involves several key steps, including **data cleaning** (handling missing values, correcting errors, and removing duplicates), **data transformation** (scaling numerical features and encoding categorical data), and **data enrichment **(adding external data for more context). This crucial stage ensures that any subsequent analysis or machine learning model is built on a solid foundation, preventing inaccuracies and flawed results.
