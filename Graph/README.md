**Graph visualization** in Python for data mining is the process of creating visual representations of complex network structures to uncover hidden patterns, relationships, and dependencies within data. These visualizations, often in the form of nodes (representing entities) and edges (representing connections), make it easier for data miners and analysts to understand and interpret data that might be too intricate to comprehend in a raw, tabular format.

**Popular Python Libraries for Graph Visualization**
Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries for creating a wide variety of visualizations, including graphs. Some of the most popular and relevant for data mining include:

  - Matplotlib: A foundational and highly flexible library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. While it's a low-level library that requires more code for complex plots, it offers a great deal of control and is often the basis for other libraries.

  - Seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn provides a high-level interface for creating aesthetically pleasing and informative statistical graphics. It's particularly good for visualizing relationships within dataframes.

  - NetworkX: This is a core library for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure and dynamics of complex networks. It's often used in conjunction with Matplotlib for visualization, as it provides the graph-building and analysis tools.

  - Plotly: Known for creating interactive, web-ready visualizations. It's excellent for building dashboards and for data exploration where users need to interact with the data directly.

  - Bokeh: A library that targets modern web browsers for output, making it ideal for creating interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications that can be embedded in web pages. It's designed for real-time data streaming and large datasets.

  - Pyvis: A simple-to-use library that facilitates the creation of interactive network graphs with minimal code, particularly useful for quickly visualizing social networks or other relationship-based data.
